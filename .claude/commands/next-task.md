Read `docs/roadmap.md` and find the first task with `[ ]` (not started).
Then read the corresponding task file in `docs/tasks/`.

Follow this workflow:
1. **PLAN**: Read the task spec thoroughly. Summarize what you will do and ask for confirmation.
2. **IMPLEMENT**: Make the changes described in the task spec. Follow the Implementation Steps.
3. **VERIFY**: Run every item in the Verification Checklist. Run the Smoke Test Script if provided.
4. **REPORT**: Show verification results. If all pass, update `docs/roadmap.md` by checking off the task `[x]`.

If any verification step fails, fix the issue and re-verify before marking complete.
